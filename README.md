# Watermarking-Deep-Neural-Networks
Watermarking Deep Neural Networks by Backdoor


A black-box watermarking approach that allows for the identification of models as the property of a specific vendor. The approach is applicable to general classification tasks and can be easily integrated with existing learning algorithms. Testing results demonstrate that the watermarking process has minimal impact on the model's primary task.
